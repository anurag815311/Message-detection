## 📌 Project Title: Message Detection

### 🔍 Description:
This project implements a **Message Spam Detection** system using machine learning techniques. The system classifies messages as **spam** or **not spam** based on their content. 

Key features of the project include:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and vectorization.
- **Feature Extraction**: Bag of Words (Count Vectorizer) and TF-IDF Transformation.
- **Model Training**: A **Random Forest Classifier** is trained on a labeled dataset to make predictions.
- **User Interaction**: The script accepts user input and predicts if the message is spam or not.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle (details provided within the code). Screenshots for the output and dataset are also included for reference.
